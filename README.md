# The-Ziv-Lempel-Algorithm-
This is a basic compression and decompression algorithm for string to integer(compression). 

These are 2 different projects. First one is  (Source_Compress.cpp & BinaryTree_Compress.h)  the compress project. Input is compin.txt(text which we will compress) and output(file) is compout.txt(integers). The second project is (Source_Decompress & BinaryTree_Decompress.h) the decompress project. Input is compout.txt(integers) and output(file) is decompout.txt (string). decompout.txt and compin.txt should match!

I used templated binary search tree(for practice) and my dictionary is in that tree. I compress string to integer and decompress integer to string. This is The-Ziv-Lempel-Algorithm. 

I hope you will like it. If there is a mistake please let me know.

Thanks,
