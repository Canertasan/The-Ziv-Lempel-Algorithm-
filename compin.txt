Introduction In this assignment you will implement an algorithm for data compression. The purpose of data compression is to take a file A and, within a reasonable amount of time, transform it into another file B in such a way that: (i) B is smaller than A, and (ii) it is possible to reconstruct A from B. A program that converts A into B is called a compressor, and one that undoes this operation is called an uncompressor. Popular programs such a
